1|A Bica de dentro||The Bica do Duarte Belo street is famous among natives and foreigners because it is the tourism point where we can find the tram elevator ('Elevador (ou Ascensor) da Bica'). From inside the tram, we can see the residents and the merchants, calmly going about their lives, under the curious looks of those who are watching that old little centenary box, going up and down since 1892.  On the other hand, the tram street at night is a lively and diverse meeting point, where we can hear diverse kinds of music, people laughing and having fun under the Lisbon moon.  The tram Elevator ('o elevador da Bica') is a captivating site, as I pass by it every day on my way to work.\n|Life event;;Architecture||||||||||||user1||user2;;user4|true|3||

3|From rejection, to Majesty||Those who pass by the neighbourhoods of Saint Anthony ('Santo António'') or the new avenues ('Avenidas Novas') could think that the major attractions here are Marquês de Pombal Square (roundabout) or Eduardo VII Park. For me, the real attraction is the Amália Rodrigues Garden, which represents the 'queen of Fado'. Queen? Only after having detached her image from the fascist regime, and singing the the great hymn for the carnations's revolution: 'Grândola Vila Morena' from Zeca Alfonso. A place full of history!\n|Historic event||||||||||||user1||user4|true|3||

5|A Graça de S. Vicente||The Cerca da Graça garden is located in the old neighbourhood of Graça, which in the 19th century integrated the extinct neighbourhoods of Saint Andrew ('Santo Andr´3') and Santa Marinha. But if today (since 2013) it is all considered Saint Vicente's ('São Vicente') neighbourhood, we can also say that it is part of Mouraria, whose neighbourhood Santa Maria Maior already integrated from its side, three of four further neighbourhoods. Isn't it charming? One that gives origins to the other, which is part of another, who integrated two more, or three or four. And so we see the day pass by from one of the highest 'Lisbon greatnesses'. And who knows that with the passing of time, the seven hills will turn into one.\n|Historic event;;Nature||||||||||||user1||user4;;user5|true|3||
